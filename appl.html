      <p id="ab">In Agriculture </p>

      <p id="la">The use of Biotechnology in Agriculture is known as Green Biotechnology. Biotechnology had contributed a lot towards the upliftment of agriculture. The organisms formed after manipulation of genes is known as Genetically Modified Organisms such as Crops, Animals, Plants, Fungi, Bacteria, etc. Genetically modified crops are formed by the manipulation of DNA to introduce a new trait into the crops. These manipulations are done to introduce traits such as pest resistance, insect resistance, weed resistance, etc. </p>
      
      <p id="ab">In Medicine </p>
      
      <p id="la">The use of biotechnology in medicine is known as Medicinal Biotechnology. This helps in the formation of genetically modified insulin known as humulin. This helps in the treatment of a large number of diabetes patients. Biotechnology has given rise to a technique known as gene therapy. Gene therapy is a technique to remove the genetic defect in an embryo or child. This technique involves the transfer of a normal gene that works over the non-functional gene.</p>
      
      <p id="ab">In Aquaculture Fisheries </p>
      
      <p id="la">It helps in improving the quality and quantity of fishes. Through biotechnology, fishes are induced to breed via gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

      <li> Transgenesis</li>
      </ul>

      <p id="ab">In the Production of Antibiotics </p> 
      <p id="la">Plants are used to develop antibiotics for Humans as well as for Animal use. It helps in the production of antibiotics, vaccines and artificial hormones for hormone therapies.<p>
       
      <p id="ab">In Environment </p>
      <p id="la">Environmental biotechnology is used in waste treatment and pollution prevention. Environmental biotechnology can more efficiently clean up many wastes than conventional methods and greatly reduce our dependence on methods for land-based disposal.  Every organism ingests nutrients to live and produces by-products as a result. Different organisms need different types of nutrients. Some bacteria thrive on the chemical components of waste products. Environmental engineers use bioremediation, the broadest application of environmental biotechnology, in two basic ways. They introduce nutrients to stimulate the activity of bacteria already present in the soil at a waste site or add new bacteria to the soil.
      <br> The 5 bacteria digest the waste at the site and turn it into harmless byproducts. After the bacteria consume the waste materials, they die off or return to their normal population levels in the environment.</p>
